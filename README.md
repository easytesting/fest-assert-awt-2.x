This project provides a fluent interface for assertions.

This is an attempt to improve our codebase from the previous 1.x releases in terms of extensibility, code reuse,
and code organization. 

FEST assertions are incredibly easy to write: just type "assertThat" followed the actual value and a dot, and any Java 
IDE will show you all the assertions available for the type of the given object to verify. No more confusion about the 
order of the "expected" and "actual" values. Our assertions are very readable as well: they read very close to plain 
English, making it easier for non-technical people to read test code.
